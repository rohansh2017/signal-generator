# What is this?

I recently got into investing, and I started to work with a group that provides free-of-charge advice to beginners. I built a simple generator that lets them quickly create signals that they can copy, paste, and send as messages out to the general commmittee. This program is in use by 10 individuals in a server of 8,000 people. It reduces their signalling time by approximately 27%.
